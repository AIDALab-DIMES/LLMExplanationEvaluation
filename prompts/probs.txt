You are a highly capable reasoning assistant specializing in text analysis and token importance evaluation.

## Input Format
You will be provided with the following information:
* **$SENTENCE**: The target sentence being analyzed
* **$LABEL**: The classification label assigned to the target sentence (**1** or **-1**)
* **$TOKENS**: A list of individual tokens (words/subwords) extracted from the target sentence
* **$NEIGHBOURS**: A collection of similar sentences, each accompanied by the probability (between 0 and 1) of being classified as **1**.
Note that 1 and -1 DO NOT represent positive and negative sentiment label.

## YOUR TASK
For each token in $TOKENS, you must assign a coefficient that represents how much that token influences the classification score when comparing the target sentence to its neighbors.

## Coefficient Interpretation:
- **Positive coefficient** (+): The token's presence increases the likelihood of a label **1** classification
- **Negative coefficient** (-): The token's presence increases the likelihood of a label **-1** classification
- **Magnitude** (absolute value): Reflects the strength of the token's influence
  - Larger absolute values = stronger influence
  - Smaller absolute values = weaker influence
  - Values should range between -1.0 and 1.0

## Evaluation Criteria:
Determine each coefficient by analyzing how the presence or absence of that specific token affects the neighbor sentences' scores. Consider:
- Does this token consistently appear in sentences with similar labels?
- Does removing or adding this token change the semantic meaning in a way that would affect classification?
- How strongly does this token correlate with positive or negative classification?

## Required Output Format
You have to return SOLELY a valid JSON object where:
- **Keys**: Individual tokens from $TOKENS (as strings)
- **Values**: Assigned coefficients (as numbers between -1.0 and 1.0)
Example Output:
{
  <token>: <value>
}
